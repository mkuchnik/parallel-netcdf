the fortran bindings are automatically generated from the c header file.  This
is nifty, but not flawless.  Compliation under 'gcc -Wall' will give some
warnings.  

If you regenerate the fortran interface, remember to fix the folowing things by hand:

nfmpi_create_:
. include <stdlib.h>

nfmpi_open_:
. include <stdlib.h>
