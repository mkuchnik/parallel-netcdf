This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * A new configure option "--disable-in-place-swap" is added. It disables
      the byte swap operations running in-place on the user's write buffers.
      The purpose of providing this option is to solve the problem when a
      Fortran program uses a put buffer which is immutable, e.g. declared as
      a PARAMETER, and in-place byte swap on user buffer can cause segmentation
      fault. See discussion threads of
      http://lists.mcs.anl.gov/pipermail/parallel-netcdf/2013-July/001498.html

      Impacts:
      1. It takes effect only on Little Endian machines.
      2. It only affects put/iput data APIs, but not attribute APIs.
      3. The INTENT of put buffer arguments in Fortran 90 put/iput APIs will be
         declared as "IN". Without this setting, the default is "INOUT".
      4. It has an impact on performance, as an internal temporary buffer will
         be allocated to copy data over from user's put buffer, so byte-swap
         can be performed on the temporary buffer.

      The default setting is to enable in-place byte swap. PnetCDF tries not to
      allocate additional memory space, due to performance concern.

    * Add Fortran paramaters for PnetCDF library version numbers:
      PNETCDF_VERSION_MAJOR, PNETCDF_VERSION_MINOR, and PNETCDF_VERSION_SUB

  o New APIs
    * ncmpi__enddef, nfmpi__enddef, and nf90mpi_enddef - these APIs correspond
      to netCDF nc__enddef, nf__enddef, and nf90_enddef (with additional
      optional arguments).

    * ncmpi_inq_file_info - the naming for ncmpi_get_file_info may cause
      confusion, as "get" has a different meaning on PnetCDF. The correct
      name should use "inq". However, ncmpi_get_file_info is kept for backward
      compatibility.

    * ncmpi_inq_striping, nfmpi_inq_striping, nf90mpi_inq_striping report the
      file system striping settings, striping size and count, if the underneath
      MPI-IO can find their values from the file system.

  o Syntax changes
    * 

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * nc_record_align_size - aligns the starting file offset of the record
      variable section. Note this is for the starting offset of the section,
      not individual records.

  o New error code
    * 

  o New run-time environment variables
    * 

  o New example programs
    * 

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * 

  o New test program
    * testcase/noclobber.c check if error code NC_EEXIST can be returned
      correctly when NC_NOCLOBBER modes is used in ncmpi_create and the file
      exists.

    * Some test programs are developed to run in parallel. The test mechanism
      for parallel runs is command "make ptest". Two environment variables
      can be used to set the MPI run command and output file directory:
      TEST_MPIRUN and TEST_OUTDIR. Their defaults are mpiexec and "." (current
      directory), respectively. For example,
          make ptest TEST_MPIRUN=aprun TEST_OUTDIR=/scratch

    * A sample PBS script file is added to test parallel programs on a batch
      queue system: pbs.script. This example script can be submitted from the
      build root directory (where you run "make" command to build PnetCDF
      library).

    * For cross compile environment (and batch queue system), the environment
      variable TEST_SEQRUN can be used to set the MPI run command. For example,
      the command for testing sequential programs:
          make check TEST_SEQRUN="aprun -n 1" TEST_OUTDIR=/scratch

      For non-cross compile environment, there is no need to set the environment
      variables, as long as one can run the MPI executable without mpirun or
      mpiexec.

  o New optimization

  o New utility program
    * pnetcdf_version prints the version information of the PnetCDF library

  o Other updates:
    * Fix build target dependency for parallel make. Now parallel make. e.g.
      "make -j8" runs much faster on many platforms, including Cray and BGQ.

    * File create was revised for handling NC_CLOBBER and NC_NOCLOBBER modes.
      On systems where Unix calls access() and unlink() are available, they
      are used to check if a file exits and delete an existing file.

    * subfiling is now enabled by default. Use --disable-subfiling to disable
      it

  o Bug fixes
    * fix ncmpigen.y on parsing CDL file to get the number of records. The bug
      failed the command "make b-test", due to getting a wrong number of
      records (current value for the unlimted dimension).
