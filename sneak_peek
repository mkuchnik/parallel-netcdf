------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * none

  o New APIs
    * ncmpi_inq_num_rec_vars() and ncmpi_inq_num_fix_vars() report the number
      of record and fixed-sized variables, respectively.
      For F77, nfmpi_inq_num_rec_vars()     and nfmpi_inq_num_fix_vars()
      For F90, nf90mpi_inq_num_rec_vars()   and nf90mpi_inq_num_fix_vars()
      For C++, NcmpiGroup::getRecVarCount() and NcmpiGroup::getFixVarCount()

  o Syntax changes
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New error code
    * NC_ENULLSTART when argument start is a NULL pointer
    * NC_ENULLCOUNT when argument count is a NULL pointer
    * NC_EINVAL_CMODE when invalid file create mode is set, (e.g. cannot have
      both NC_64BIT_OFFSET & NC_64BIT_DATA. In PnetCDF 1.5.0 and earlier
      versions, if both flags were set, then NC_64BIT_OFFSET triumphs
      NC_64BIT_DATA.)

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New example programs
    * transpose.c shows how to use ncmpi_put_vara_int_all to write a 3D array
      that is dimensional-transposed from the one stored in memory. Six
      transposed 3D arrays are saved whose dimensions are organized as ZYX,
      ZXY, YZX, YXZ, XZY, and XYZ. The C++, Fortran 77, and Fortran 90
      versions are also provided.

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/modes.c tests if correct error codes are returned when
      various file create/open modes are used.
    * test/testcases/varn_int.c tests varn APIs
    * test/testcases/inq_num_vars.c tests if one can correctly inquire the
      numbers of record and fixed-sized variables defined in a netCDF file.
      A similar program in F90, named inq_num_varsf.f90, is also added.
    * test/nonblocking/interleaved.c tests a combination of interleaved
      file types. This is to test the bug fix in r1758.

  o New optimization
    * none

  o New utility program
    * none

  o Other updates:
    * A new configure option, --enable-large-file-test, to enable testing
      I/O on large files and large variables. Note the testing prgrams will
      run very slowly.

  o Bug fixes
    * fix the bug when the first group of file types are interleaved, it
      was mistakenly identified as non-interleaved. See r1758.
    * fix the setting for PNETCDF_RELEASE_DATE in configure.in. Using read
      command together with IFS does not work as expected in bash 4.3.11. See
      http://lists.mcs.anl.gov/pipermail/parallel-netcdf/2014-July/001586.html
      for further detailed discussion.
