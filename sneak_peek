      For C,   ncmpi_iput_varn_int() ncmpi_iget_varn_int()

      For F77, nfmpi_put_var1_all() nfmpi_get_var1_all()
      For F90, API overloading
      For C++, API overloading
    * ncmpi_inq_recsize() returns the size of record block, i.e. the sum of
      single records of all record variables.
      For F77, nfmpi_inq_recsize()
      For F90, nf90mpi_inq_recsize()
      For C++, NcmpiGroup::getRecSize()
    * ncmpi_inq_num_rec_vars() and ncmpi_inq_num_fix_vars() report the number
      of record and fixed-size variables, respectively.
      For F77, nfmpi_inq_num_rec_vars()     and nfmpi_inq_num_fix_vars()
      For F90, nf90mpi_inq_num_rec_vars()   and nf90mpi_inq_num_fix_vars()

  o Syntax changes
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o PnetCDF hint priority
    * The alignment hints set in the environment variable "PNETCDF_HINTS" have
      the highest priority, which overwrite the alignment hints set in
      ncmpi__enddef(), which overwrite the alignment hints set in the MPI_Info
      object used in the call of ncmpi_create() and ncmpi_open().

  o New error code
    * NC_ETYPESIZE when filetype size is bigger than the variable size
    * NC_ETYPE_MISMATCH when the element type of filetype mismatches the
      variable type
    * NC_ETYPESIZE_MISMATCH when filetype size mismatches buffer type size
    * NC_ENULLSTART when argument start is a NULL pointer
    * NC_ENULLCOUNT when argument count is a NULL pointer
    * NC_EINVAL_CMODE when invalid file create mode is set, (e.g. cannot have
      both NC_64BIT_OFFSET & NC_64BIT_DATA. In PnetCDF 1.5.0 and earlier
      versions, if both flags were set, then NC_64BIT_DATA triumphs
      NC_64BIT_OFFSET.)

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New example programs
    * C/vard_int.c F77/vard_int.f F90/vard_int.f90 CXX/vard_int.cpp show
      how to use vard API to write/read record and fixed-size variables.
    * transpose.c shows how to use ncmpi_put_vara_int_all to write a 3D array
      that is dimensional-transposed from the one stored in memory. Six
      transposed 3D arrays are saved whose dimensions are organized as ZYX,
      ZXY, YZX, YXZ, XZY, and XYZ. The C++, Fortran 77, and Fortran 90
      versions are also provided.

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/test_vard.c test/testcases/test_vardf.f
      test/testcases/test_vardf90.f90 tests the new vard APIs.
    * test/testcases/inq_recsize.c tests if one can correctly inquire the
      size of record block from in a netCDF file. A similar program in F90,
      named inq_recsizef.f90, is also added.
    * In test/nc_test, the test programs below are borrowed from netCDF test
      programs: t_nc.c tst_misc.c tst_norm.c tst_small.c tst_names.c
      tst_atts3.c tst_atts.c
    * test/testcases/one_record.c tests the special case defined in CDF-1 and
      CDF-2 specification that "A special case: Where there is exactly one
      record variable, we drop the requirement that each record be four-byte
      aligned, so in this case there is no record padding."
    * test/testcases/modes.c tests if correct error codes are returned when
      various file create/open modes are used.
    * Under test/testcases, varn_int.c varn_intf.f varn_real.f90 test varn APIs
    * test/testcases/inq_num_vars.c tests if one can correctly inquire the
      numbers of record and fixed-size variables defined in a netCDF file.
      A similar program in F90, named inq_num_varsf.f90, is also added.
    * test/nonblocking/interleaved.c tests a combination of interleaved
      file types. This is to test the bug fix in r1758.

  o New optimization
    * none

  o New utility program
    * none

  o Other updates:
    * Conform with netCDF4 on CDF-1 and CDF-2 formats. The only difference
      between the two formats are the OFFSET item in the format spec (32 vs.
      64 bit integers.) All names (variable, dimension, attribute) now allow
      extended characters (eg. special2 and MUTF8).
    * The flexible APIs now allow argument buftype to be MPI_DATATYPE_NULL.
      In this case, argument bufcount is ignored and argument buf's data type
      must match the data type of variable defined in the file - no data
      conversion will be done. This extension makes the flexible APIs be
      able to correspond to the netCDF APIs whose names do not contain a data
      type, e.g. nc_put_vara().
    * Type conversion between NC_BYTE and unsigned char no longer checks for
      out of range error (NC_ERANGE). NetCDF specification make a special case
      for this kind of data type conversion. See:
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs_rc/data_type.html#type_conversion
    * Conform with the CDF-2 and CDF-5 formats that names are normalized
      according to Unicode NFC normalization rules during encoding as UTF-8
      for storing in the file header.
    * A new configure option, --enable-large-file-test, to enable testing
      I/O on large files and large variables. Note the testing prgrams will
      run very slowly.

  o Bug fixes
    * fix the bug for flexible get_varn API. When buftype is noncontiguous, the
      bug forgot to "unpacks" the temporary buffer that reads data from file to
      the user buffer using buftype.
    * fix the bug in blocking flexible get APIs when buftype is noncontiguous,
      swap is needed, type conversion is not. The bug sets a NULL pointer to the
      read buffer and passes it to MPI_File_read functions. See r1815.
    * fix the bug for the NetCDF special case when there is only one record
      variable and the record size is not four-byte aligned. In this case,
      NetCDF spec says the alignment must dropped (no padding). See r1791.
    * fix the bug in nonblocking APIs when requests are resorted into
      nonoverlapping groups and the first group of file types are interleaved,
      it was mistakenly identified as non-interleaved. See r1758.
    * fix the setting for PNETCDF_RELEASE_DATE in configure.in. Using read
      command together with IFS does not work as expected in bash 4.3.11. See
      http://lists.mcs.anl.gov/pipermail/parallel-netcdf/2014-July/001586.html
      for further detailed discussion.
