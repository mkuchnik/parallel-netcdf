This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * none

  o New APIs
    * none

  o Syntax changes
    * ncmpi_cancel can now be called in define mode.

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New error code
    * none

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New example programs
    * none

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/scalar.c to test if arguments start, count, stride, and
      imap are properly ignored when getting/putting a scalar variable

  o New optimization
    * Add a table lookup based on Bernstein hash function for checking whether
      a variable/dimension name has already been used.
    * Replace the use of linked lists with arrays for storing the pending
      nonblocking requests, in expectation of save time for traversing the
      linked list.

  o New utility program
    * none

  o Semantics updates
    * In netCDF-3, whether the contents of an NC_BYTE variable are signed or
      unsigned is determined by the calling APIs. For signed APIs, NC_BYTE
      variables are signed. For unsigned APIs (i.e. _uchar APIs) they are
      unsigned. NetCDF-3 specifically makes an exception to skip NC_ERANGE
      check when calling _uchar APIs on NC_BYTE variables. See
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs_rc/data_type.html#type_conversion
      In netCDF-4 and CDF-5, because of the introduction of the new data type
      NC_UBYTE, an unsigned 8-bit integer, which renders the exception less
      sense. Thus, for CDF-5 files, regular NC_ERANGE check is performed in
      PnetCDF for all APIs that access NC_BYTE variables. For CDF-1 and 2
      files, PnetCDF still honors that exception.

  o Other updates:
    * Clarify support for CDF-2 and CDF-5 formats. When the size of MPI_Offset
      is less than 8 bytes, support for CDF-2 and CDF-5 is disabled.

  o Bug fixes
    * Fix the return unlimited dimension ID of value -1, not 0, by Fortran API
      nfmpi_inq_unlimdim when no unlimited dimension is defined. This conforms
      with netCDF convention. See r3296 and r1372
    * Fix string processing the environment variables set for PnetCDF I/O hints
      See r2385
    * Fix utility ncmpidiff to use collective read APIs in collective data mode
      See r2382
